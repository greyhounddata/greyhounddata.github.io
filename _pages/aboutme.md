### Welcome to Greyhound Data! 

I'm a UK based Data Scientist and Mathematician. I have multiple years of experience in Mathematics, Programming and *Data Science*. 

I have three goals in mind for this website:
- To act as a portfolio and a place to demonstrate some of my skills to future employers.

- I love teaching and share knowledge. I hope to use this site to share tutorials and my upcoming textbook. 

- I often do small data science projects in my spare time, but I do them for myself to scratch an intellectual itch. I thought having an outlet like this might encourage me to polish these projects and share them with others.
